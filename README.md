# Atlas_File_Size_Data
### File size distribution data for the Atlas 1 &amp; 2 filesystem at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility


The .CSV file in this repo contains histogram data about file sizes and file counts for the Atlas 1 & 2 filesystems.  (It's actually a dump of raw events from our Splunk index.) The data runs from Nov 13, 2017 to Jan 23, 2018.  The .PDF file contains histograms rendered from the Jan 23 data.

We've had requests from some vendors for access to this data.  If you're not supplying parallel filesystems for supercomputers, it's probably not much use to you.
